Nondeterministic CPU
====================

Here we present the first nondeterministic CPU.

It has a word size of 1 bit and a stack of at least 5 bits as well as one accumulator register. It does not have a instruction memory - all instructions are fed from the outside.

This CPU can solve NP hard problems in P-TIME steps.
